              <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">The Nifty meaning is a derivation from the mix of two words, i.e. “National Stock Exchange” and “fifty”. It is an abbreviation of the National Stock Exchange Fifty. It is a collection of top performing 50 equity stocks that are actively trading in the index.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">Nifty is the Index used by the National Stock Exchange and is made by the combination of National and Fifty (Nifty). Unlike Sensex, Nifty collects the sample of 50 performing and luring stocks to determine the market trends.
            Similar to Sensex, Nifty picks stocks from different sectors. Some of these include the stocks from the sectors such as IT, Consumer Goods, financial services, automobiles, telecommunication, and more. Besides, stocks picked under Nifty are those that outperform others.</p>  
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">Criteria to qualify for Nifty are -</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">1. Liquidity</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">2. Float Adjustment</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">3. Domicile</p>

              <h1 class="text-gray-900 text-3xl title-font font-medium mb-4">What Is Sensex?</h1>
              <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">The term Sensex refers to the benchmark index of the BSE in India. The Sensex is comprised of 30 of the largest and most actively traded stocks on the BSE and provides a gauge of India's economy. It is float-adjusted and market capitalization-weighted. The Sensex is reviewed semiannually each year in June and December.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">Sensex, aka Sensitive Index, is the Index for the Bombay Stock Exchange. As discussed earlier, an index is a sample of listed companies that act as the representative. Over 6000 companies are listed under the Bombay Stock Exchange, and practically it would be impossible to analyze the performance individually.To solve this issue, BSE uses Sensex. Sensex picks up 30 companies that are luring, performing, and best for the market. If these companies are performing poorly, then the market trends are down. However, if only these 30 companies are outperforming, then the market trends are bullish.</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">There is a certain criterion that the Bombay Stock Exchange use to pick companies under Sensex. A few of these criteria are -</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">1. Market Capitalization.</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">2. Trading Frequency.</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">3. High Liquidity.</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">4. Industry Representation.</p>
          <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-4">5. Average daily turnover.</p>
