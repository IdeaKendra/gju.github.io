        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">What Are IPOs?</h1></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">The process of Initial Public Offering (IPO) transforms a privately-held company into a public company. This process also creates an opportunity for smart investors to earn a handsome return on their investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Investing in IPOs can be a smart move if you are an informed investor. But not every upcoming IPO is a great opportunity. Benefits and risks go hand-in-hand. Before you join the bandwagon, it is important to understand the basics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Initial Public Offering (IPO) can be defined as the process in which a private company or corporation can become public by selling a portion of its stake to the investors. An IPO is generally initiated to infuse the new equity capital to the firm, to facilitate easy trading of the existing assets, to raise capital for the future, or to monetize the investments made by existing stakeholders.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">Types of IPO</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-xl text-gray-600">There are two common types of IPO. They are:</h1></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4"><b>1. Fixed Price Offering</b> ::
          Fixed Price IPO can be referred to as the issue price that some companies set for the initial sale of their shares. The investors come to know about the price of the stocks that the company decides to make public.
          The demand for the stocks in the market can be known once the issue is closed. If the investors partake in this IPO, they must ensure that they pay the full price of the shares when making the application.<br>
          <b>2.  Book Building Offering</b> ::
          In the case of book building, the company initiating an IPO offers a 20% price band on the stocks to the investors. The interested investors bid on the shares before the final price is decided. Here, the investors need to specify the number of shares they intend to buy and the amount they are willing to pay per share.
          The lowest share price is referred to as floor price and the highest stock price is known as cap price. The ultimate decision regarding the price of the shares is determined by investors’ bids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">How to invest in an IPO?</h1></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Any investor without a Demat account cannot apply for an IPO. The function of a Demat account is to provide the investors with the provision to store shares and other financial securities electronically. One can open a Demat account by submitting his Aadhaar card, PAN card, address and identity proofs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">The Application Process</h1>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">An investor can apply for an IPO through his bank account or trading account. Some financial organizations will offer you the provision to bunch your Demat, trading and bank accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">After an investor has created the demat-cum-trading account, he needs to be familiar with the Application Supported by Blocked Account (ASBA) facility. It is mandatory for every IPO applicant. The ASBA is an application that enables the banks to arrest funds in the applicant’s bank account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">The ASBA application forms are made available to the IPO applicants in both demat and physical form. However, the use of cheques and demand drafts can not be made to avail the facility. An investor needs to specify his demat account number, PAN, bidding details and bank account number in the application.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">Bidding</h1>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">An investor needs to bid while applying for the shares in an IPO. It is done according to the lot size quoted in the company’s prospectus. Lot size can be referred to as the minimum number of shares that an investor has to apply for in an IPO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">A price range is decided and the investors require to bid within the price range. Though an investor can make a revision in his biddings during an IPO, it should be noted that he needs to block the required funds while bidding. In the meantime, the arrested amount in the banks earns interest until the process of allotment is initiated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-3xl text-gray-900">Allotment</h1>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">In many cases, the demand for the shares can exceed the actual number of stocks released in the secondary market. One can also face situations where he can get a fewer number of shares than what he had demanded. In these cases, the banks unlock the arrested funds either entirely or partially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">But, if an investor is lucky enough to get a full allotment, he would receive a CAN (Confirmatory Allotment Note) within six working days after the IPO process is done. After the shares have been allotted, they are credited to the investor’s demat account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Once the above-mentioned steps are carried on successfully, the investor will have to wait for the listings of the stocks in the share market. It is generally done within seven days after the shares are finalised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4"><b>On a closing note ,</b><br>Initial Public Offerings are generally considered beneficial as it lets the issuer company enlarge their equity base and increase their exposure and prestige. At the same time, it provides investors with an opportunity to gain handsome returns. However, one must be watchful of the latest IPOs and have a clear understanding of analyzing financial metrics in order to identify the opportunities.</p>
