        <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-2xl text-gray-900">Check These Fundamentals :</h1><p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">1) Does the Company innovate?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">A company has to keep updating its technology to improve efficiency. Kodak, Nokia are examples of big brands which failed to innovate and ignored the power of technology. When better products came into the market, these companies suffered because they did not update themselves.</p><b>    
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">2) What is the size?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Avoid a small fish in a very big pond such as a JK Tyre. In fact, prefer large companies in a big pond such as MRF because with their scale, networking and brand power they will be able to grow faster when times are good. As seen from the chart, JK Tyre has given -39% while MRF has returned 61% absolute returns to investors in the past four and a half years.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">3) Is it a falling knife?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Never put your hands in a stock which is already falling. PC Jewellers, Suzlon are examples to stay away from in order to avoid making losses.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">4) Is it a low ROE business?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">The sole reason for investments is returns and a company with a history of low ROE won’t improve overnight. Investments in high ROE companies will create value for shareholders.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">5) Should you look for cyclical plays?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Cyclicals such as cement, sugar, auto can be loss-making when picked at the peak of their cycle. Timing is everything in cyclicals and requires caution. Therefore, secular companies are safer than cyclical.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">6) Are the shares liquid enough?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4"> When a stock suddenly falls, you panic and want to sell it but can’t; it is all because of low liquidity. Lower volumes and liquidity will prevent from finding buyers when you want to sell a stock or vice versa.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">7) Does it have poor corporate governance?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4"></p>Satyam is an example of poor corporate governance. Management and board of directors should be ethical and reliable.<b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">8) How transparent is the Company?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Companies should explicitly disclose their related party transactions to maintain transparency to avoid cases such as the Karvy episode. A qualified auditor’s report is also essential to highlight the authenticity of a Company’s transactions.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">9) Is it a penny stock?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">High risks can make higher returns but it can also make you lose money if the company goes bankrupt or if a scam surfaces. It is best to avoid penny stocks.</p><b>
        <p>&nbsp;</p><p class="text-xl text-black-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">10) How much has the promoter pledged and how much do promoters hold?</p></b>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Companies with a high promoter pledge or low promoter holding are red flags. To release pledged shares, the Company will have to generate sufficient cash flows. Also, a low or declining promoter holding may imply that the promoters don’t have faith in the growth of their own company. If a promoter himself is invested in his own company, then he is more prone to take unbiased business decisions and will allocate capital keeping the longer objective in mind.</p>
